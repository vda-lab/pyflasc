# Horse-shaped mesh-reconstruction dataset

This horse-shaped mesh-reconstruction dataset is obtained from [a STAD
repository](https://github.com/vda-lab/pySTAD). The meshes were originally
created or adapted for a paper by [Robert W. Sumner and Jovan Popovic
(2004)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1015706.1015736#d17686678e1). They
can be downloaded and are described in more detail on [their
website](https://people.csail.mit.edu/sumner/research/deftransfer/data.html).
