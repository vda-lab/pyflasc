# Parkinson's dataset

This dataset was part of a [Kaggle
challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predicting-parkinson-s-disease-progression-with-smartphone-data/data)
issued by the [Michael J. Fox
foundation](https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/data-challenges). It contains
samples recorded roughly between December 2011 and March 2012 for 9 parkinson's
patients and 7 healthy controls roughly matched for age and gender.

The subjects were asked to carry a supplied Android smartphone on their person
for at least one charge-cycle per day (about 4-6 hours) during 8 weeks, as
consistently as possible. The data was recorded at most once per second in
various forms:

- Audio
- Accelerometry
- Compass
- Ambient light
- Proximity
- Battery level
- GPS
