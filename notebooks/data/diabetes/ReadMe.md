# Diabetes dataset

In 1979, [Reaven, Miller &
Alto](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00423145) analysed the
difference between chemical and overt diabetes in 145 non-obese adults.
Previously, they had found a "horse shoe" relation between plasma glucose and
insulin response levels, confirmed by later studies. However, the interpretation
of this relationship remained unclear. It could be interpreted as the natural
progression of diabetes or as different underlying causes for the disease. In
their 1979 work, they attempted to quantify the relationship to gain insight
into the pattern.

The data from their study is obtained from the [Chemical and Overt
Diabetes](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-5098-2_37)
chapter in [Data: A Collection of Problems from Many Fields for the Student and
Research Worker](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-5098-2).
