v0.1.3
    This version matches the first major revision of our paper:
    - Notable changes to eccentricity definition and branch hierarchy
      simplification. Eccentricity is now directly defined by distance to 
      cluster centroids. 
    - Fixes to branch-membership centrality measure and the update labelling
      function. It no longer changes labels of non-noise points. 
    - New and updated figures included in the paper.
    - Re-evaluated all benchmark notebooks.
    - Removed Cython as install dependency.
